          <h3>Cookies – what are they?</h3>
          <p>A ‘cookie’ is a small file containing data stored on your device's web browser when visiting specific websites. Cookies may or may not contain personal data about a visitor.</p>
          <p>Why are cookies used? In order to properly work, every modern website uses cookies.</p>
          <p>They have different tasks that generally make it easier and more interactive for you to use our websites. For example, through cookies we collect information about your visit and site behavior so you do not have to repeatedly submit it to us. Thereby, we can recognize you next time visiting our websites and show you the information you need.</p>
          <p>Cookies help us understand how you use our services so that we can constantly improve them by customizing the content and suggestions to you based on your preferences and interests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>What are the types of cookies?</h3>
          <p>Depending on how long they are stored on your device, cookies are categorized as ‘permanent’ and ‘temporary’ (‘session’) cookies.</p>
          <ul class="innerlist">
              <li>Permanent cookies are stored on your computer or mobile device for a long period time, which can last years;</li>
              <li>Temporary (session) cookies are used when you visit our websites, but they are deleted and are not permanently stored on your device when your session is completed, for example by closing the webpage.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>Depending on their features, cookies can generally be categorized as four different types:</p>
          <ul class="innerlist">
              <li>strictly necessary cookies;</li>
              <li>functionality cookies;</li>
              <li>performance cookies;</li>
              <li>targeting or advertising cookies.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Strictly necessary cookies</p>
            <p>They are strictly necessary for our websites to perform their functions.</p>
            <p>We use them, for example, to identify our users when they use our websites so that we can provide our services or we can perform and maintain the security of our services. These cookies do not collect information about you that can be used for marketing or advertising. Your consent to use these cookies is implied by the very use of our websites, therefore you cannot refuse using them.</p>
            <p>Functionality cookies</p>
            <p>These cookies deliver the various functionalities of our websites. They enable us to remember your preferences, such as font size and other preferences, saving you time and effort to indicate a user name every time you visit our website or to view content preferred by you.</p>
            <p>When using our online services, these cookies may contain important information about your previous behavior in the product.</p>
            <p>Performance cookies</p>
            <p>These cookies are not strictly necessary but allow us to customize your experience on our websites.</p>
            <p>The information stored by ‘efficiency cookies’ helps us understand how you use our websites, remember and check the history of your previous visits, what you have viewed or tagged or how you have found us.</p>
            <p>We will then use such data to improve our websites and services for a better experience.</p>
            <p>We do not use the data collected from these cookies for the purpose of serving an advertisement or for customizing it.</p>
            <p>Targeting or advertising cookies</p>
            <p>Our goal is to provide visitors to our website with information that best suits them. This is achieved not only through the content of our site but also through advertisements displayed. Since we need to continue display advertisements, we want them to be useful and relevant to you to the extent possible.</p>
            <p>In order to achieve that goal, we try to get an idea of your possible interests based on the websites that you visit and the behavior in relation to the different content and advertising. Consequently, based on such interests, we adapt the displayed content and advertisements on our websites to the different user groups.</p>
